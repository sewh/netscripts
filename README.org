* netscripts

netscripts is a small script for managing network interfaces, inspired by OpenBSD's [[https://man.openbsd.org/hostname.if.5][hostname.if]] and Linux network script packages of old.

** Usage

Once installed, netscripts can be invoked with 'ns <interface name> <action>', for example 'ns eth0 up'. In this example, ns then looks for a script in /etc/netscripts/scripts called 'eth0-up' and executes it if it finds it. You will typically want to write 'up', 'down', and 'reload' scripts.

netscripts can run network scripts automatically on boot. To do this with systemd, ensure that netscripts.timer is enabled. Then, you can enable the scripts to run with 'ns enable <interface> <action>'. For example, 'ns enable eth0 up' will cause the /etc/netscripts/scripts/eth0-up script to be run on boot. Scripts can be disabled with the 'ns disable <interface> <action>' command.
